# 2024 nvim config files

### Install

- Clone this repo into `~/.config`
- Rename `nvim_2024` root folder to `nvim` (essentially, this repo should live at `~/.config/nvim`)
- Open any folder or file in nvim
- You should see the Lazy installer popup window installing all the packages
- If you don't, try to run `:Lazy` (if that doesn't work, something wasn't installed correctly)
